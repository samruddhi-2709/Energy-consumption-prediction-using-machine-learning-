This project focuses on predicting energy consumption for an electrical blower machine using time-series data collected at 10-15 minute intervals via IoT devices. It leverages advanced analytical techniques to forecast energy usage, facilitating improved energy management and operational efficiency in industrial settings.

The dataset features energy measurement in kilowatt-hours (KWh) computed between consecutive timestamps. Energy values below 0.5 KWh indicate that the machine was non-operational during those time slots. The data represents stationary time-series characteristics, making it ideal for forecasting tasks.

Key features of this project include time-series decomposition (using both additive and multiplicative methods) to extract seasonal, trend, and residual components, and the implementation of autoregression (AR) models to forecast future energy consumption patterns.

This project demonstrates the application of predictive analytics for industrial IoT data, supporting better decision-making for energy management and optimizing operational efficiency.
